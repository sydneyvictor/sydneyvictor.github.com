## Studio Policies

By submitting payment, you reserve a spot in my studio for the year and agree to respect and abide by the studio policies.

### Schedule

 * The studio year runs from September to June.  We will break for 2 weeks at Christmas and 1 week during Spring Break.
 * We will have at least two recitals: at Christmas and in the spring.
 * If the student must miss a lesson due to illness or a family emergency, please contact the teacher by phone or e-mail as soon as possible, preferably in advance. One week is reserved at the end of the year for make-up lessons.
 * The teacher reserves the right to offer make-up lessons outside of that week on a case-by-case basis, but is under no obligation to do so.
 * If the teacher must miss a lesson, the lesson will be rescheduled or refunded.
 * If the student wishes to take lessons for a partial year, please contact me to work out payment and scheduling details. I have a limited number of spaces available for this type of tuition.
 * For online lessons, the lesson will be rescheduled if the online connection cannot be established within 5 minutes of the lesson time.


### Payment

 * Lesson Fees for the semester must be paid in advance (by the first of the month): You may pay by cheque, cash, or e-transfer. If you need to make alternate payment arrangements, please discuss that with me before payment is due.
 * A $20 late fee will apply to all lesson and other fees. The teacher reserves the right to apply or waive the fee based on the payment history of the account in question.
 * Please make all checks payable to Sydney Victor. The payee will be responsible for any NSF cheque fees incurred.


### Lesson Rates

The teacher reserves the right to raise tuition at the beginning of each year.

#### Monthly Studio Lesson Rates

Students who wish to take regular lessons can take advantage of the following discounted rates. 1 month includes 4 lessons.

Studio lessons are recommended when possible, however, I also provide online lessons for students who are unable to meet at the studio. A reliable Internet connection capable of video chat is required. As with monthly studio rates, 1 month includes 4 lessons.

#### Other Costs

 * Book purchases for lessons will be discussed as needed and arranged individually.
 * All festival and exam fees will be invoiced separately from regular lesson fees.


### Lesson Expectations

* Students are expected to arrive at the lesson on time with all of their music and lesson materials.
* Parents are encouraged to observe the lessons.
* Students must be committed to practice between lessons. I understand that there will be times when the expectations below will not be possible due to illness and the unexpected, but this should be the exception, not the norm.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Lesson Length</th>
            <th>Practice Time</th>
            <th>Days per Week</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>30 minutes</td>
            <td>10-30 minutes</td>

            <td>30-60 minutes</td>
            <td>5-7</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Discontinuation

 * If the student decides to discontinue lessons, the teacher must be notified with a written, thirty-day notice. 
 * Payment is due during this thirty-day period whether or not lessons are taken.
