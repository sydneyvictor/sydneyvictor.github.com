## Studio Policies

By submitting payment, you reserve a spot in my studio for the year and agree to respect and abide by the studio policies.

### Schedule

 * The studio year runs from September to June.  We will break for 2 weeks at Christmas and 1 week during Spring Break.
 * We will have at least two recitals: at Christmas and in the spring.
 * Attendance is expected at all scheduled lessons, as each lesson time is reserved exclusively for that student.  Enrolling in lessons is a purchase of a specific time slot with the instructor.  There will be no tuition credits for missed lessons or recitals.
 * If the student must miss a lesson, 24-hours notice is required.  If the lesson will be missed due to sudden illness or a family emergency, please contact the teacher by phone or e-mail as soon as you are able to.
 * If the teacher must miss a lesson, the lesson will be rescheduled or refunded.
 * If the student wishes to take lessons for a partial year, please contact me to work out payment and scheduling details. I have a limited number of spaces available for this type of tuition.
 * For online lessons, the lesson will be rescheduled if the online connection cannot be established within 5 minutes of the lesson time.


### Payment

 * Lesson Fees for each month must be paid in advance (by the first of the month): You may pay by cheque, cash, or e-transfer.  If you need to make alternate payment arrangements, please discuss that with me before payment is due.
 * A $20 late fee will apply to all lesson and other fees.
 * Please make all checks payable to Sydney Victor. The payee will be responsible for any NSF cheque fees incurred.


### Tuition and Fees

The teacher reserves the right to raise tuition at the beginning of each year.

#### Studio & Online Lesson Tuition

The following rates are applicable for students who wish to take lessons for less than one year or would like to space lessons further apart than one week (i.e. bi-weekly or once a month). Studio lessons are recommended when possible, however, I also provide online lessons for students who are unable to meet at the studio. A reliable Internet connection capable of video chat is required.

#### Discounted Lesson Tuition

Students who wish to take regular lessons on a weekly basis for one full year can take advantage of the discounted monthly lesson rates.  Students who wish to take lessons for less than one full year will not be eligible for any discount; they will be charged the full cost per lesson.  The studio year runs from September through June

#### Other Fees

 * Book purchases for lessons will be discussed as needed and arranged individually.
 * All festival and exam fees will be invoiced separately from regular lesson tuition.


### Lesson Expectations

* Students are expected to arrive at the lesson on time with all of their music and lesson materials.
* Parents are encouraged to observe the lessons.
* Students must be committed to practice between lessons. I understand that there will be times when the expectations below will not be possible due to illness and the unexpected, but this should be the exception, not the norm.

        </tr>
    </tbody>

### Discontinuation

 * If the student decides to discontinue lessons, the teacher must be notified with a written, thirty-day notice. 
 * Payment is due during this thirty-day period whether or not lessons are taken.  

### Dismissal from Lessons

Regrettably, should any of the following situations become habitual, the parents will be notified that the student has been placed on probation.  After parents have been notified, continuation of the problem will result in termination of lessons without refund.
* Persistent absence
* Repeated failure to pay tuition on time
* Uncooperative attitude
* Discourtesy towards the teacher or another student by a child or his/her parent
